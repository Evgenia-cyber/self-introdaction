Hello. My name is Evgenia and I am a junior frontend developer.
I graduated from the Marine Technological Institute in Kerch. Now I am studying at RSSchool frontend course.
I got interested in programming a few years ago. We can say - by accident. And somehow imperceptibly got involved. I want programming to become my job over time, not just a hobby.
I don't have any commercial development experience yet. But I have good analytical skills, easy to learn and I work well in a team.
Recently I have been working on a training project RSSchool - Momentum. This is an analogue of the eponymous application of the online store Chrome.
I used in it the following technologies: css, html and js.
App show time and date, also has a personal greeting, to-do, weather, audio player, quote, settings.                                                                
The background image and greeting change depending on the time of day.
The application remembers the username and the city specified by the user.
Momentum is one of my favorite tasks. Not always everything worked out right away.
The most difficult thing was to implement the settings, namely, changing the languages ​​and changing the source of the image for the background. I had to tinker so that the settings saved in local storage were displayed correctly.
The layout is adaptive and works on different screen extensions - up to 320px
I tried to keep the design uniform and in my opinion the application turned out to be quite nice.
Another my favorite RSSchool task is Photo-filter. Here you can change filter settings, background color, photo size. You can also upload an image from your computer and save the created image.
Thanks. It's all. Have a nice day. Bye.
